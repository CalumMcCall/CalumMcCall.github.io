<h1>
  About Me
</h2>
<p>
  Iâ€™m a software engineer with over a decade of experience, everything from complex backend
  applications to full-stack and mobile apps with over 500k users.
</p>
<p>
  I currently work mainly with Scala and have particular expertise with functional-reactive
  programming as well as microservices architectures. I've worked lots with Java and C# too.
  I used to work at <a href="https://wire.com">Wire</a>, on the Android client, a cutting-edge open-source E2EE messenger, so I have lots of
  expertise designing and maintaining complex, client-heavy, security-focused Android apps. I'm also
  a huge proponent of open-source software.
</p>
<p>
  I'm currently looking for fully-remote roles only, either freelance or full-time. Although I'm
  open to discussing contract roles based in Berlin, where I live.
</p>
<p>
  I can be contacted at "calummccall2 AT gmail". I can provide a CV on request.
