<p>
  Iâ€™m a software engineer with over a decade of experience in building complex backend applications to full-stack and mobile apps with over 500k users.
</p>
<p>
  My current focus is functional-reactive programming and microservices architectures in Scala, but I've also done substantial work in other languages such as Java and C#.

  I'm a huge proponent of open-source software. For the past few years, I worked at <a href="https://wire.com">Wire</a>, a cutting-edge open-source E2EE messenger, where I gained expertise designing and maintaining a complex security-focused Android app. 
</p>
<p>
  I'm currently looking for fully-remote roles, either freelance or full-time. However, I'm open to discussing contract roles based in Berlin, where I live. 

  Feel free to check out some of <a href="https://github.com/CalumMcCall">my open-source contributions</a> and reach out at "calummccall2 AT gmail" if you're interested in working with me.
